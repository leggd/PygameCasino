How to Play
to play blackjack first you will have to enter your name,

place a bet with the credits that you have in your balance,

once bet is done the game starts and the game starts with the buttons the player needs to press,

hit(H), Stand(S) these two buttons are to stand so that you declare that you will not be drawing a card and then the opponent will draw until higher or over 21.

hit(H) allows the player to get a new card adding to their total getting closer to 21. 

to play again press R on the keyboard to restart once you have won or lost that round.

Project Description:
Blackjack is a Python game that challenges players to build a hand value as close as possible to 21 without exceeding it, whilst competing against the dealer. 
Players aim to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. If a player achieves a hand value of 21 with their initial two cards, they automatically win the round.
